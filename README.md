EmbyStat is a personal web server that can calculate all kinds of statistics from your (local) Emby server. Just install this on your server and let him calculate all kinds of fun stuff. For more reallife statistics you do have to install the EmbyStat plugin on your Emby server as well!

This project is still in Alpha fase, but feel free to pull in on your computer and test it out yourself. When the time is right I will host a full informational website/release for common platforms and Wiki pages.

# Installation
Supported platforms as the moment are:
* Windows x64 (IIS and Kestrel)

I love your input! I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Pull requests
I use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. I actively welcome your pull requests. You can make a pull request by following the next guidelines:
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `dev`. Use following url to fork: `https://github.com/mregni/EmbyStat.git`
2. Add your code.
* Frontend code is located in the EmbyStat.Web project.
* Backend code starts in the EmbyStat.Controllers project.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
* Test project is located in Tests.Unit
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!
